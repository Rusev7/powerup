## Personal fitness assistant web app

### App goals:
 - to keep user's workouts on the database;
 - to keep track of user's weight, height, etc.;
 - to help users to track their own progress ( _not done yet_ );
 
---
### The app is made with:
 - ReactJS;
 - Express;
 - MongoDB ( Mongoose );
 
#### Back-end dependencies:
 - bcrypt;
 - body-parser;
 - cors;
 
In order to use the app, every user must register, so the app can keep the user's info in the database. A **blog system** is being developed in now, after it's completion, the _guest_ users will be able to use it as well as the registered will be too. The progress tracker system will be developed too so every user will be able to check his progress( weight, fitness exercises and things like arm size, chest size, etc.).
